# Exact-release offline evidence

`source-inventory.json` is generated from Git objects at release-6.0.6, commit
87e94dbd9f930135e0694cd7e7d49f210603cd2c. HEAD and the working tree are never
used as oracle inputs. It records hashes, static registration defaults, record
shapes, candidate expressions and references. Candidate expressions deliberately
include false positives; they are an inventory for Q00, not an evaluator. A
reference cycle may be an ordinary backlink; it does not prove a grant cycle.
Missing references are relative to the modern bundled subset, not proof of a
broken native installation. Actual caller access and hydrated payloads are
separate M1/E01 evidence.

`source-before.json` is module-authored synthetic JSON. `expected.json` is a
separate manually specified S oracle: advancement storage migration from
`AdvancementTemplate.#migrateStorage`, source identity from `SourceField`, and
WIS 14 => +2, level 5 => proficiency +3, multiplier 1 => skill +5/passive 15 from
`CharacterData`/`CreatureTemplate.prepareSkill`. This is not captured native
preparation: `nativePrepared` is explicitly null. The intended no-write action
retains the entire source, including nested effects, flags and extension fields.
Only decode expectations are consumed until M2 implements the skill interpreter.

`index.json` identifies evidence, settings, revisions, licenses and payload hashes.
Unknown installed host/module archive identities stay null. No live endpoint,
credentials, purchased text, native art or native runtime is included. Inventory
formula fragments and IDs identify source semantics, not a redistributed book.
Upstream software is MIT (Foundry Gaming LLC); SRD 5.1/5.2 text is CC BY 4.0,
Dungeons & Dragons, Wizards of the Coast LLC. See upstream `LICENSE.txt`/`README.md`
at the pinned commit and the module's existing font license inventory.

Read-only comparison (Core toolchain with js-yaml/TypeScript required):

```sh
npm run test:native-source -- --native /path/to/dnd5e --core /path/to/core
```

A missing checkout, wrong release tag or changed inventory fails. To deliberately
regenerate after review, supply `--write-inventory /absolute/output.json`, compare
that file, and update provenance; never silently bless changes in ordinary tests.
Native N/action capture and installed I/U harnesses remain open acceptance gates.
