# D&D 5e module architecture

`info.json` is the compatibility authority. The module requires Core 0.18.0
and UI API 3.1; the remaining API ranges are declared there. Its experimental
designation is intentional and must not be removed as release housekeeping.

The adapter prepares Actors deterministically without writing derived values
back to Foundry. Sheets, cards and rolls consume the shared prepared model.
Core owns authorization, world/session lifecycle, roll execution and shared
chat/media/dice presentation. Use public SDK contracts, not private host APIs.

The self-hosted fonts and their provenance/licenses are documented in
[assets/fonts/README.md](../assets/fonts/README.md).

## Initiative

Core resolves a saved GM override first, then the module formula, then its
generic fallback. The HUD adapter reuses the module's roll frame and returns
only a roll choice or final manual total. The resolved formula and audience
are read-only; default execution preserves the expression, while permitted
Advantage/Disadvantage choices are explicit overrides.

Sheet bonus/configuration fields do not recalculate the HUD formula. Centering,
scrolling and narrow-screen button layout belong to the shared module frame.
This integration does not provide native Foundry browser-hook/effect parity.

## Preparation limits

Experimental status includes known differences between module-prepared and native
values. The existing prepared-actor tests preserve bounded behavior; they do not
prove complete native rule parity. Native preparation-runtime research remains
separate from shipping functionality. No connected native frontend or backend
browser is required for normal module operation.

## Distribution and verification

`info.json` declares the module version and API compatibility. CI/release
workflows currently use the released Core `v0.18.0` toolchain. Release assets
include the package archive, checksum, catalog manifest and release history.
A module release tag identifies the matching manifest version.

Repository workflow and verification commands live in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).
The shared contracts are described in Core's
[module authoring guide](https://github.com/sheetdelver/sheetdelver/blob/v0.18.0/docs/MODULE_AUTHORING.md)
and [release process](https://github.com/sheetdelver/sheetdelver/blob/v0.18.0/docs/RELEASING.md).
